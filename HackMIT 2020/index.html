      <p><strong>We hoped to see how the outcomes and prevalence of complaints against police officers differed based on the race, gender, and geographic location of the complainant. We also looked at the differences in outcome based on the type of complaint. Filing a police report is not easy. In Philadelphia, you need to go to a police district to file a report you need to fill out a form and mail, email or physically drop it off. We want to make police harassment and abuses of power more visible in the City of Brotherly Love.</strong></h3>
